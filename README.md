Apple Watch Latency Test
==
This repo tries to simulate the communication latency between Apple Watch and WatchKit app via BTLE.

There are two components in this repo, Server and WatchClient:
>WatchClient acts as the WatchKit app running on Apple Watch Side while the Server acts like WatchKit extension running on iPhone.

To experience this test, you need two iOS devices that support BTLE (iPhone 4s or later). Please make sure you turned on Bluetooth on both devices.
